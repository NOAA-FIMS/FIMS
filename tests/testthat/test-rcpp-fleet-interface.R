# Instructions ----
#' This file follows the format generated by FIMS:::use_testthat_template().
#' Necessary tests include input and output (IO) correctness [IO
#' correctness], edge-case handling [Edge handling], and built-in errors and
#' warnings [Error handling]. See `?FIMS:::use_testthat_template` for more
#' information. Every test should have a @description tag that takes up just
#' one line, which will be used in the bookdown report of {testthat} results.

# rcpp fleet ----
## Setup ----

# Load or prepare any necessary data for testing
## IO correctness ----

  #' @description Test that two selectivity modules can be set up without any
  #' errors and they have the appropriate ids.
  # Create selectivity for fleet 1

  # Create selectivity for fleet 2

  #' selectivity and no output, errors, messages, or warnings are produced
  #' when setting the SelectivityIDs for the fleets.
  # Add selectivity to fleet

  #' within the fleet module.

## Edge handling ----
# No edge cases to test for this interface.


## Error handling ----

  #' given a string rather than an integer.
