# Instructions ----
#' This file follows the format generated by FIMS:::use_testthat_template().
#' Necessary tests include (1) Input and output (IO) correctness [IO
#' correctness], edge-case handling [Edge handling], and built-in errors and
#' warnings [Error handling]. See `?FIMS:::use_testthat_template` for more
#' information. Every test should have a @description tag that takes up just
#' one line, which will be used in the bookdown report of {testthat} results.

# EWAAgrowth ----
## Setup ----
# Prepare data
fims_frame <- FIMS::FIMSFrame(data1)
# Ensure that the fims_frame object is removed after tests are completed
on.exit(rm(fims_frame), add = TRUE)

# Initialize an EWAAgrowth object
ewaa_growth <- methods::new(EWAAgrowth)
# Assign age data to the EWAAgrowth object
ages <- get_ages(fims_frame)
ewaa_growth$ages$resize(length(ages))
purrr::walk(
  seq_along(ages),
  \(x) ewaa_growth$ages$set(x - 1, ages[x])
)

# Assign weight data to the EWAAgrowth object
weights <- m_weight_at_age(fims_frame)
ewaa_growth$weights$resize(length(weights))
purrr::walk(
  seq_along(weights),
  \(x) ewaa_growth$weights$set(x - 1, weights[x])
)
on.exit(ewaa_growth)

# Set up a different EWAAgrowth object
ewaa_growth2 <- methods::new(EWAAgrowth)
on.exit(ewaa_growth2)

## IO correctness ----
test_that("EWAAgrowth evaluate() works with correct input data", {
  #' @description Test that EWAAgrowth evaluate(1) returns the first value in the weight-at-age data.
  expect_equal(ewaa_growth$evaluate(1), 0.00053065552)
})

test_that("EWAAgrowth get_id() works with correct input data", {
  #' @description Test that id of ewaa_growth is 1.
  expect_equal(ewaa_growth$get_id(), 1)
  #' @description Test that id of ewaa_growth2 is 2.
  expect_equal(ewaa_growth2$get_id(), 2)
})
# Clear any previous FIMS settings
clear()

## Edge handling ----

  # Initialize an EWAAgrowth object
  ewaa_growth <- methods::new(EWAAgrowth)
  # Assign age data to the EWAAgrowth object

  )
  #' @description Test that EWAAgrowth evaluate(1) throws an error when weights are missing.
  expect_error(ewaa_growth$evaluate(1))
  # Clear any previous FIMS settings
  clear()
})

## Error handling ----
test_that("EWAAgrowth evaluate() returns expected error for mismatched input lengths", {
  # Initialize an EWAAgrowth object
  ewaa_growth <- methods::new(EWAAgrowth)
  # Assign age data and intentionally mismatch the length of ages and weights

    seq_along(weights),
    \(x) ewaa_growth$weights$set(x - 1, weights[x])
  )
  #' @description Test that EWAAgrowth evaluate() throws an error when the
  #' lengths of ages and weights don't match.
