# Instructions ----
#' This file follows the format generated by FIMS:::use_testthat_template().
#' Necessary tests include (1) Input and output (IO) correctness [IO
#' correctness], edge-case handling [Edge handling], and built-in errors and
#' warnings [Error handling]. See `?FIMS:::use_testthat_template` for more
#' information. Every test should have a @description tag, which can span
#' multiple lines, that will be used in the bookdown report of the results from
#' {testthat}.

# EWAAgrowth ----
## Setup ----
# Prepare data
fims_frame <- FIMS::FIMSFrame(data1)
# Ensure that the fims_frame object is removed after tests are completed
on.exit(rm(fims_frame), add = TRUE)

# Initialize an EWAAgrowth object
ewaa_growth <- methods::new(EWAAgrowth)
# Assign age data to the EWAAgrowth object
ages <- get_ages(fims_frame)
ewaa_growth$ages$resize(length(ages))
purrr::walk(
  seq_along(ages),
  \(x) ewaa_growth$ages$set(x - 1, ages[x])
)

# Assign weight data to the EWAAgrowth object
weights <- m_weight_at_age(fims_frame)
ewaa_growth$weights$resize(length(weights))
purrr::walk(
  seq_along(weights),
  \(x) ewaa_growth$weights$set(x - 1, weights[x])
)
on.exit(ewaa_growth)

# Set up a different EWAAgrowth object
ewaa_growth2 <- methods::new(EWAAgrowth)
on.exit(ewaa_growth2)

## IO correctness ----
test_that("EWAAgrowth evaluate() works with correct input data", {
  #' @description Test that EWAAgrowth evaluate(1) returns the first value in the weight-at-age data.
  expect_equal(ewaa_growth$evaluate(1), 0.00053065552)
})

test_that("EWAAgrowth get_id() works with correct input data", {
  #' @description Test that id of ewaa_growth is 1.
  expect_equal(ewaa_growth$get_id(), 1)
  #' @description Test that id of ewaa_growth2 is 2.

# Clear any previous FIMS settings

## Edge handling ----

## Error handling ----
