# Runs devtools::document() and styler::style_active_package() when a PR is
# opened or updated, then opens a pull request with changes targeting the
# feature branch.
#
# Workflow Trigger:
# - This workflow runs when a pull request is opened or updated (synchronized)
#   targeting the 'main' or 'dev' branches.
# - The R code styling and documentation is applied to the source (head) branch
#   of the PR, NOT to main or dev.
# - If styling/documentation changes are needed, a new PR will be created targeting
#   the original feature branch.
# - Example: If PR from 'feature-branch' -> 'dev' needs styling, a new PR will be
#   created targeting 'feature-branch'.
# - The styling PR must be merged into the feature branch before the original
#   PR can be merged into main/dev.
#
# This workflow calls a reusable workflow from nmfs-ost/ghactions4r that handles
# the actual R code documentation and styling operations.
