# Runs clang-format to format C++ code when a PR is opened or updated,
# then creates a PR with formatting changes targeting the feature branch.
#
# Workflow Trigger:
# - This workflow runs when a pull request is opened or updated (synchronized) 
#   targeting the 'main' or 'dev' branches.
# - The formatting is applied to the source (head) branch of the PR, NOT to
#   main or dev.
# - If formatting changes are needed, a new PR will be created targeting the 
#   original feature branch.
# - Example: If PR from 'feature-branch' -> 'dev' needs formatting, a new PR 
#   'format-c++-code-feature-branch' -> 'feature-branch' will be created.
# - The formatting PR must be merged into the feature branch before the original
#   PR can be merged into main/dev.
#
# Clang-Format Version Update:
# - Previously, we were using clang-format version 13.0.0.
# - The latest available version is 18.0.0, which is now the default in the GitHub action.
# - We explicitly set `clangFormatVersion: 18.0.0` to ensure consistency.
# - Clang-format 17 had known bugs that could cause formatting failures, so we are avoiding auto-updating.
# - Future updates should be reviewed before upgrading to a new major version.
