# Runs clang-format to format C++ code and then creates a PR to the branch
# that had changes and triggered this action.
#
# Clang-Format Version Update:
# - Previously, we were using clang-format version 13.0.0.
# - The latest available version is 18.0.0, which is now the default in the GitHub action.
# - We explicitly set `clangFormatVersion: 18.0.0` to ensure consistency.
# - Clang-format 17 had known bugs that could cause formatting failures, so we are avoiding auto-updating.
# - Future updates should be reviewed before upgrading to a new major version.
#

# - Clang-Format: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html
