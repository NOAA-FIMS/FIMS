# Run clang-format
# This workflow runs clang-format to format C++ code and then creates
# a pull request to commit the changed files to the main branch.
#
# Clang-Format Version Update:
# - We updated clang-format from version 13.0.0 to 18.0.0.
# - The GitHub Action we are using (DoozyX/clang-format-lint-action@v0.14) defaults to 18.0.0.
# - Using an outdated version could lead to formatting inconsistencies.
# - We chose to explicitly set 18.0.0 instead of using "latest" because Clang 17 had known issues
#   that could have caused failures in our workflow.
# - Future updates should be reviewed before upgrading to a new major version.
