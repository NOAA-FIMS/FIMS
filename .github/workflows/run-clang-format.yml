# Run clang-format
# This workflow runs clang-format to format C++ code and then creates
# a pull request to commit the changed files to the main branch. 
# More details about clang-format can be found here: 
# https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html. To style 
# C++ code in VS Code locally, you could follow the instructions on this 
# website https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_formatting 
# to format the entire file or selected text.
