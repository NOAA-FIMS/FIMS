# Overview
The repository for development of FIMS. 

The NOAA Fisheries Integrated Modeling System is a software system designed and architected to support next-generation fisheries stock assessment, ecosystem, and socioeconomic modeling. A team of experts within NOAA Fisheries is designing and developing the system, and we are advised by the FIMS Council which includes academic, industry, and international partners. The roles of internal and external collaborators are outlined in the [governance section](https://noaa-fims.github.io/collaborative_workflow/fims-governance.html) of our developer guide. We plan to have an operational software system that is released to the public in 2023. In the meantime, users and developers are welcome to submit feedback using Github issues. Please use the issues under [collaborative workflow](https://github.com/NOAA-FIMS/collaborative_workflow/issues) to make suggestions about the [developer guide](https://noaa-fims.github.io/collaborative_workflow/) and the issues under the FIMS software [repo](https://github.com/NOAA-FIMS/FIMS/issues) for software design and development feedback. You can follow the team discussion [here](https://github.com/NOAA-FIMS/FIMS/discussions).
