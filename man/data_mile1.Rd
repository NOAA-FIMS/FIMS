\title{FIMS input data frame for milestone 1}
\format{
A data frame with 1140 observations of
8 variables:
\describe{
\item{type}{The type of data the row contains. Allowed types include
\code{age}, \code{index}, \code{landings}, and \code{weight-at-age} data.}
\item{name}{A character string providing the name of the information source
that the data was collected from, e.g., \code{"Trawl fishery"}}
\item{age}{An integer age. Entry can be \code{NA} if information pertains to
multiple ages, e.g., total catch rather than catch of age-4 fish.}
\item{datestart,dateend}{Start and end dates of the data collection period.
Format all dates using \code{yyyy-mm-dd}, which can accommodate fake years
such as \code{0001-01-01}.}
\item{value}{The measurement of interest.}
\item{unit}{A character string specifying the units of \code{value}. Allowed
units for each data type are as follows. \code{mt} is used for \code{index},
\code{landings}, and \code{weight-at-age} data. \code{number} or \code{proportion} are each
viable units for the composition data, where the former is the preferred
unit of measurement.}
\item{uncertainty}{A real value providing a measurement of uncertainty
for value. For catches and survey indices of abundance this should be
the standard deviation of the logged observations if you are using the
lognormal distribution to fit your data. For composition data it will
be your input sample size.

\description{
A dataset containing information necessary to run an age-structured stock
assessment model in FIMS for milestone 1. This data was generated using
the \code{ASSAMC} package written for the \href{www.github.com/Bai-Li-NOAA/Age_Structured_Stock_Assessment_Model_Comparison}{model comparison project}.
