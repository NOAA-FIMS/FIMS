\title{Class constructors for \code{FIMSFrame} and associated child classes}
\usage{
FIMSFrame(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} that contains the necessary columns to construct
a \code{FIMSFrame-class} object. Currently, those columns are
type, name, age, length, datestart, dateend, value, unit, and uncertainty. See
the data1 object in FIMS, e.g., \code{data(data1, package = "FIMS")}.}
}
\value{
An object of the S4 class \code{FIMSFrame} class, or one of its child classes, is
validated and then returned. All objects will at a minimum have a slot
called \code{data} to store the input data frame. Additional slots are dependent
on the child class. Use \code{\link[methods:RClassUtils]{methods::showClass()}} to see all available slots.
}
\description{
All constructor functions take a single input and build an object specific
to the needs of each model type within \pkg{FIMS}. \code{FIMSFrame} is the parent
class. Future, associated child classes will have the additional slots
needed for different types of models.

\details{
\subsection{data}{

The input data are both sorted and expanded before returning them in the
data slot.
\subsection{Sorting}{

It is important that the order of the rows in the data are correct but it is
not expected that the user will do this. Instead, the returned data are
sorted using \code{\link[dplyr:arrange]{dplyr::arrange()}} before placing them in the data slot. Data
are first sorted by data type, placing all weight-at-age data next to other
weight-at-age data and all landings data next to landings data. Thus,
age-composition data will come first because their type is "age" and "a" is
first in the alphabet. All other types will follow according to their order
in the alphabet.
Next, within each type, data are organized by fleet. So, age-composition
information for fleet1 will come before survey1. Next, all data within type
and fleet are arranged by datestart, e.g., by year. That is the end of the
sorting for time series data like landings and indices.
The biological data are further sorted by bin. Thus, age-composition
information will be arranged as follows:\tabular{lcccr}{
   type \tab name \tab datestart \tab age \tab value \cr
   age \tab fleet1 \tab 2022-01-01 \tab 1 \tab 0.3 \cr
   age \tab fleet1 \tab 2022-01-01 \tab 2 \tab 0.7 \cr
   age \tab fleet1 \tab 2023-01-01 \tab 1 \tab 0.5 \cr
}


Length composition-data are sorted the same way but by length bin instead of
by age bin. It becomes more complicated for the age-to-length-conversion
data, which are sorted by type, name, datestart, age, and then length. So, a
full set of length, e.g., length 10, length 20, length 30, etc., is placed
together for a given age. After that age, another entire set of length
information will be provided for that next age. Once the year is complete
for a given fleet then the next year will begin.
