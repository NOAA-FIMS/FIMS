\title{Class constructors for \code{FIMSFrame} and associated child classes}
\usage{
FIMSFrame(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} that contains the necessary columns to construct
a \code{FIMSFrame-class} object. Currently, those columns are
type, name, age, length, datestart, dateend, value, unit, and uncertainty. See
the data1 object in FIMS, e.g., \code{data(data1, package = "FIMS")}.}
}
\value{
An object of the S4 class \code{FIMSFrame} class, or one of its child classes, is
validated and then returned. All objects will at a minimum have a slot
called \code{data} to store the input data frame. Additional slots are dependent
on the child class. Use \code{\link[=showClass]{showClass()}} to see all available slots.
}
\description{
All constructor functions take a single input and build an object specific
to the needs of each model type within \pkg{FIMS}. \code{FIMSFrame} is the parent
class. Future, associated child classes will have the additional slots
needed for different types of models.
