\title{Covert the dimension information from a FIMS json output into a tibble}
\usage{
dimensions_to_tibble(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A list containing the header and dimensions information from a
FIMS json output object.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing ordered rows for each combination of the dimensions.
}
\description{
Dimensions in the json output are stored as a list of length two, with the
header information containing the name of the dimension and the dimensions
containing integers specifying the length for each dimension. The result
helps interpret how the FIMS output is structured given it is dimension
folded into a single vector in the json output.
}
\details{
The dimension index is returned not the actual year of the model. For
example, if the model starts in year 1900, then year_i of 1, which is what
is returned from this function will need to map to 1900 and that will need
to be done externally.
This function will accommodate dimensions of year-1 and year+1 where the
indexing of the former will start at 2 instead of 1.
