\item{\code{spelling_package}: Contains a 2-column data frame of words that need

\description{
FIMS consists of both C++ and R code but no function exists to style,
document, and test both file types. This function first works with the C++
code and then moves onto the R code. For each file type it styles the files,
e.g., puts in appropriate spacing between brackets; then it build the
documentation, e.g., \code{\link[roxygen2:roxygenize]{roxygen2::roxygenize()}}; and then it tests the
functions.
