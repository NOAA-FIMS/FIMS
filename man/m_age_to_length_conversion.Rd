\title{Get the age-to-length-conversion data from a FIMSFrame object}
\usage{
m_age_to_length_conversion(x, fleet_name)

\S4method{m_age_to_length_conversion}{FIMSFrame}(x, fleet_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A FIMSFrame object with age-to-length-conversion data (i.e.,
the proportion of age "a" that are length "l").}

\item{fleet_name}{A string providing the name of the fleet for which you
want the length-composition data for. Technically, you can pass it a
vector of strings but it is more common to pass it a single string.}
}
\value{
A vector of age-to-length-conversion data. The order of the vector is the
order the data frame was in before this function was called because it is
just extracting a column.
