\description{
Initializes a generic module by setting up its fields based on the provided
\code{module_name}.

Initializes a distribution module by setting up its fields based on the
distribution name and type. Supports both "data" and "process" types.

Initializes a recruitment module by setting up fields. This function uses
the \code{initialize_module} function to handle specific requirements for
recruitment initialization.

Initializes a growth module by setting up fields. This function uses
the \code{initialize_module} function to handle specific requirements for
growth initialization.

Initializes a maturity module by setting up fields. This function uses
the \code{initialize_module} function to handle specific requirements for
maturity initialization.

Initializes a population module by setting up fields. This function uses
the \code{initialize_module} function to handle specific requirements for
population initialization.

Initializes a selectivity module by setting up fields. This function uses
the \code{initialize_module} function to handle specific requirements for
population initialization.

Initializes a fleet module by setting up its fields. It links selectivity,
index, and age composition modules.

Initializes an index module based on the provided data and fleet name.

Initializes an age composition module for a specific fleet,
setting the age composition data for the fleet over time.

Initializes multiple modules within the Fisheries Integrated Modeling System (FIMS),
including fleet, recruitment, growth, maturity, and population modules.
This function iterates over the provided fleets, setting up necessary sub-modules such as
selectivity, index, and age composition. It also sets up distribution models for fishery
index and age composition data.
