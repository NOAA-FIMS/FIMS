\usage{
use_gtest_template(name = "FileName_ClassName_FunctionName")
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{A string representing the combined name for the C++ test file
and CMake executable target. It must follow the format
\code{FileName_ClassName_FunctionName}, where
\itemize{
\item \code{FileName} is the C++ source file name (e.g., "Logistic")
\item \code{ClassName} is the C++ class name (e.g., "LogisticSelectivity")
\item \code{FunctionName} is the C++ function name (e.g., "Evaluate")
and use underscores to separate each component. For example:
\code{Logistic_LogisticSelectivity_Evaluate}.
}

If the function is not a member of a class, use a placeholder for
\code{ClassName}. For example: \code{FIMSMath_ClassName_Logistic}.

The default is \code{FileName_ClassName_FunctionName}.}
}
\value{
If successful, this function invisibly returns \code{TRUE} to allow for the
chaining of commands. If the function is unsuccessful, an error message is
returned.

Three messages are also returned from the usethis package, which is used by
this function. The first states where the FIMS project is on your computer.
The second states the file path of the newly created file. The file will not
be automatically opened. The third states the test has been registered in
\code{tests/gtest/CMakeLists.txt}.

\description{
This helper function generates a GoogleTest (gtest) C++ template file for a
given function and appends lines to \code{CMakeLists.txt} to register the test.
