\usage{
m_agecomp(x, fleet_name)

\S4method{m_agecomp}{FIMSFrame}(x, fleet_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object returned from \code{\link[=FIMSFrame]{FIMSFrame()}}.}

\item{fleet_name}{A string providing the name of the fleet for which you
want the age-composition data. Technically, you can pass it a
vector of strings but it is more common to pass it a single string.}
}
\value{
A vector of age-composition data. The order of the vector is the order
the data frame was in before this function was called because it is just
extracting a column.
