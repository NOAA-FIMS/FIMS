\usage{
fit_fims(
  input,
  getsd = TRUE,
  loopnum = 3,
  do.fit = TRUE,
  newtonsteps = 0,
  control = NULL,
  save.sdrep = FALSE,
  filename = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Input list as returned by
\code{prepare_input}.}

\item{getsd}{Calculate and return sdreport?}

\item{loopnum}{A positive integer specifying the number of iterations of
the optimizer that will be performed to improve the gradient.}

\item{do.fit}{Optimize (TRUE, default) or (FALSE) build and return
a list containing the obj and report slot.}

\item{newtonsteps}{The number of Newton steps using the inverse
Hessian to do after optimization.}

\item{control}{A list of optimizer settings passed to code{nlminb}}

\item{save.sdrep}{Whether to return the sdreport object in the
fitted model. This is rarely used and large so turned off by
default. When returned it is named \code{sdrep}.}

\item{filename}{Character string giving a file name to save
the fitted object as an RDS object. Defaults to 'fit.RDS',
and a value of NULL indicates not to save it. If specified,
it must end in .RDS. The file is written to folder given by
\code{input$path}.}
}
\value{
If \code{do.fit} is TRUE then a list object of class 'fimsfit'
which contains a "version" model name, rep, parList (MLE in list format),
opt as returned by \code{nlminb}, std (formatted data frame) and sdrep if
\code{getsd=TRUE}, and the obj. If \code{do.fit} is FALSE then it returns
a list containing the TMB obj and rep slot for the report.
