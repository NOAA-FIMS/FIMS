# Introduction

This guide covers the three methods to set up the FIMS environment.

## Method 1: Google Cloud Workstations

This is the fastest method for the training session.

1.  Open your terminal in the Workstation.
2.  Run the following command:

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-FIMS/FIMS/add-google-cloud-workstations-bash/setup_fims.sh)
```

## Deep Dive: What does this script do? (Click to expand)
The setup_fims.sh script performs several automated tasks:

- Checks OS: Detects you are on Linux.

- Installs Dependencies: checks for system libraries like libxml2.

- Configures R: Sets up ~/.Renviron to use a persistent library in your Home directory.

- Installs Packages: Downloads pre-compiled binaries from Posit Package Manager (PPM) to save time.
