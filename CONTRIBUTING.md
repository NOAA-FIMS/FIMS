A comprehensive set of guidelines for contributing to NOAA's Fisheries Integrated Modeling System can be found in our [NMFS Fish Tools Organization](https://noaa-fims.github.io/collaborative_workflow/contributor-guidelines.html) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request to the [collaborative workflow document](https://github.com/NOAA-FIMS/collaborative_workflow).

## How can I contribute?

Not all contributions are code! Writing documentation, teaching, and other activities are also key parts of contributing to software, and guidelines for how to do this are covered in the [collaborative workflow book](https://noaa-fims.github.io/collaborative_workflow/contributor-guidelines.html). For more information about open source contributions, see [the Open Source Guide's How to Contribute page](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).
