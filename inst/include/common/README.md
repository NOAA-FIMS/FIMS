## Common

This directory contains common header files that are used across different parts of the project, i.e., between the interface, the TMB objective function, and the mathematics and population dynamics components of the package. These headers define common data structures, utility functions, and macros that are shared among various components.

The directory contains no additional structure, as all common headers are placed directly within this directory. This flat structure is intended to simplify access to these common headers, making it easier for developers to include them in their code without navigating through multiple subdirectories.

This directory also includes `mainpage.dox` that serves as the entry point for the Doxygen documentation. It provides an overview of the project, its purpose, and its structure.
