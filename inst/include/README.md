# FIMS C++ Code

This directory includes .hpp C++ header files that often contain class and struct definitions, function prototypes, template declarations and definitions, inline function definitions, and constants and macros. We use .hpp extension instead of .h because .h declares a file a header file but not necessarily a header file that contains C++ code; though the extensions can be used interchangeably. Header files are essential for modular programming in C++, serving as interfaces, declaring functions, classes, and other entities that are defined in the corresponding ../source/*.cpp files or directly within the header itself (for templates and inline functions). They allow the compiler to understand the structure of the code and ensure that different parts of the program can interact correctly. When a .cpp file includes a .hpp file, the compiler gains access to the declarations within the header, enabling it to compile the code that uses those declarations.

The header files in this directory are organized into subdirectories based on their functionality or the components they represent. This organization helps maintain a clear structure and makes it easier to locate specific headers when working on different parts of the codebase. The subdirectories may include headers related to data structures, algorithms, utilities, and other components that are part of the FIMS C++ codebase.
