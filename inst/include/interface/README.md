## Interface

This directory contains the Rcpp interface files for the FIMS C++ code. The interface files are responsible for exposing the C++ functionality to R, allowing users to call C++ functions and access C++ classes directly from R. R, while flexible and expressive, can be slow for computationally intensive tasks and lacks direct support for low-level operations. Directly calling C++ from R is non-trivial due to mismatches in data types, memory handling, and function calling conventions. Rcpp addresses these mismatches by providing an abstraction layer that simplifies the interface process, allowing C++ code to be written in a way that's naturally accessible from R. The interface files typically include function definitions, class declarations, and other necessary components to facilitate communication between R and C++. By using Rcpp package, we can leverage the performance benefits of C++ while still providing a user-friendly interface for R users.

Typically, Rcpp exposes C++ functions to R using the Rcpp::export placed before the C++ function code. This enables automatic wrapper generation and type conversion. Unfortunately, we cannot use this functionality within a TMB model, and thus the code here may be slightly more complicated than a typical Rcpp interface. Classes are made available via RCPP_MODULE. RCPP_MODULE provides a declarative mechanism to register C++ classes and their members (constructors, methods, fields) so they can be accessed from R via Rcpp modules where class constructors and methods are explicitly bound for R access. For templates, direct export isn't supported, but individual instantiations can be wrapped in type-specific functions.

At the top level, this directory contains just three files, `init.hpp`, `interface.hpp`, and `rcpp_interface.hpp`. The `init.hpp` file is responsible for initializing the Rcpp interface, while the `interface.hpp` file contains the main interface definitions. The `rcpp_interface.hpp` file is a wrapper that allows R to call C++ functions and access C++ classes seamlessly and each of the header files within `rcpp_objects` must be listed in this file.

Within the `rcpp_objects` subdirectory, there are several header files that define the C++ classes and functions that will be exposed to R. Each of these header files corresponds to a specific component or functionality within the FIMS C++ codebase.
